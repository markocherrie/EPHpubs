"Occupational differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection: analysis of the UK ONS COVID-19 infection survey.","Concern remains about how occupational SARS-CoV-2 risk has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to ascertain occupations with the greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore how relative differences varied over the pandemic."
"Longitudinal changes in proportionate mortality due to COVID-19 by occupation in England and Wales.","Analysis of cohort data from the UK Office of National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey from April 2020 to November 2021. This survey is designed to be representative of the UK population and uses regular PCR testing. Cox and multilevel logistic regression were used to compare SARS-CoV-2 infection between occupational/sector groups, overall and by four time periods with interactions, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, region, household size, urban/rural neighbourhood and current health conditions."
"The relationship between greenspace and personal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> during walking trips in Delhi, India.","Based on 3 910 311 observations (visits) from 312 304 working age adults, elevated risks of infection can be seen overall for social care (HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.24), education (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.39), bus and coach drivers (1.43; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.97) and police and protective services (HR 1.45; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.62) when compared with non-essential workers. By time period, relative differences were more pronounced early in the pandemic. For healthcare elevated odds in the early waves switched to a reduction in the later stages. Education saw raises after the initial lockdown and this has persisted. Adjustment for covariates made very little difference to effect estimates."
"Contamination of Air and Surfaces in Workplaces with SARS-CoV-2 Virus: A Systematic Review.","Elevated risks among healthcare workers have diminished over time but education workers have had persistently higher risks. Long-term mitigation measures in certain workplaces may be warranted."
"Antenatal Exposure to UV-B Radiation and Preeclampsia: A Retrospective Cohort Study.","This study aimed to understand whether the proportionate mortality of COVID-19 for various occupational groups has varied over the pandemic."
"Climatic factors are associated with asthma prevalence: An ecological study using English quality outcomes framework general practitioner practice data.","We used the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data for England and Wales. The deaths (20-64 years) were classified as either COVID-19-related using ICD-10 codes (U07.1, U07.2), or from other causes. Occupational data recorded at the time of death was coded using the SOC10 coding system into 13 groups. Three time periods (TP) were used: (i) January 2020 to September 2020; (ii) October 2020-May 2021; and (iii) June 2021-October 2021. We analyzed the data with logistic regression and compared odds of death by COVID-19 to other causes, adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, region, urban/rural and population density."
"A data linkage study of the effects of the Great Recession and austerity on antidepressant prescription usage.","Healthcare professionals and associates had a higher proportionate odds of COVID-19 death in TP1 compared to non-essential workers but were not observed to have increased odds thereafter. Medical support staff had increased odds of death from COVID-19 during both TP1 and TP2, but this had reduced by TP3. This latter pattern was also seen for social care, food retail and distribution, and bus and coach drivers. Taxi and cab drivers were the only group that had higher odds of death from COVID-19 compared to other causes throughout the whole period under study [TP1: odds ratio (OR) 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.99-2.93; TP2: OR 3.15, 95% CI 2.63-3.78; TP3: OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.26-2.29]."
"Trajectories in mental health and socio-spatial conditions in a time of economic recovery and austerity: A longitudinal study in England 2011-17.","Differences in the odds of death from COVID-19 between occupational groups has declined over the course of the pandemic, although some occupations have remained relatively high throughout."
"Life Course Air Pollution Exposure and Cognitive Decline: Modelled Historical Air Pollution Data and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.","The presence of urban greenspace may lead to reduced personal exposure to air pollution via several mechanisms, for example, increased dispersion of airborne particulates; however, there is a lack of real-time evidence across different urban contexts. Study participants were 79 adolescents with asthma who lived in Delhi, India and were recruited to the Delhi Air Pollution and Health Effects (DAPHNE) study. Participants were monitored continuously for exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm) for 48 h. We isolated normal day-to-day walking journeys (n = 199) from the personal monitoring dataset and assessed the relationship between greenspace and personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> using different spatial scales of the mean Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), mean tree cover (TC), and proportion of surrounding green land use (GLU) and parks or forests (PF). The journeys had a mean duration of 12.7 (range 5, 53) min and mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> personal exposure of 133.9 (standard deviation = 114.8) μg/m<sup>3</sup>. The within-trip analysis showed weak inverse associations between greenspace markers and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations only in the spring/summer/monsoon season, with statistically significant associations for TC at the 25 and 50 m buffers in adjusted models. Between-trip analysis also indicated inverse associations for NDVI and TC, but suggested positive associations for GLU and PF in the spring/summer/monsoon season; no overall patterns of association were evident in the autumn/winter season. Associations between greenspace and personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> during walking trips in Delhi varied across metrics, spatial scales, and season, but were most consistent for TC. These mixed findings may partly relate to journeys being dominated by walking along roads and small effects on PM<sub>2.5</sub> of small pockets of greenspace. Larger areas of greenspace may, however, give rise to observable spatial effects on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, which vary by season."
"Use of sequence analysis for classifying individual antidepressant trajectories to monitor population mental health.","This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence for air and surface contamination of workplace environments with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the quality of the methods used to identify actions necessary to improve the quality of the data."
"Changing levels of local crime and mental health: a natural experiment using self-reported and service use data in Scotland.","We searched Web of Science and Google Scholar until 24 December 2020 for relevant articles and extracted data on methodology and results."
"Neighborhood Crime and Psychotropic Medications: A Longitudinal Data Linkage Study of 130,000 Scottish Adults.","The vast majority of data come from healthcare settings, with typically around 6% of samples having detectable concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and almost none of the samples collected had viable virus. There were a wide variety of methods used to measure airborne virus, although surface sampling was generally undertaken using nylon flocked swabs. Overall, the quality of the measurements was poor. Only a small number of studies reported the airborne concentration of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, mostly just reporting the detectable concentration values without reference to the detection limit. Imputing the geometric mean air concentration assuming the limit of detection was the lowest reported value, suggests typical concentrations in healthcare settings may be around 0.01 SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA copies m-3. Data on surface virus loading per unit area were mostly unavailable."
"Exposure to Solar UV During Outdoor Construction Work in Britain.","The reliability of the reported data is uncertain. The methods used for measuring SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in work environments should be standardized to facilitate more consistent interpretation of contamination and to help reliably estimate worker exposure."
"UVA and Seasonal Patterning of 56 370 Myocardial Infarctions Across Scotland, 2000-2011.","Background Risk of preeclampsia varies by month of delivery. We tested whether this seasonal patterning may be mediated through maternal vitamin D concentration using antenatal exposure to UV-B radiation as an instrumental variable. Methods and Results Scottish maternity records were linked to antenatal UV-B exposure derived from satellites between 2000 and 2010. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the association between UV-B and preeclampsia, adjusting for the potential confounding effects of month of conception, child's sex, gestation, parity, and mean monthly temperature. Of the 522 896 eligible singleton deliveries, 8689 (1.66%) mothers developed preeclampsia. Total antenatal UV-B exposure ranged from 43.18 to 101.11 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> and was associated with reduced risk of preeclampsia with evidence of a dose-response relationship (highest quintile of exposure: adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.72; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Associations were demonstrated for UV-B exposure in all 3 trimesters. Conclusions The seasonal patterning of preeclampsia may be mediated through low maternal vitamin D concentration in winter resulting from low UV-B radiation. Interventional studies are required to determine whether vitamin D supplements or UV-B-emitting light boxes can reduce the seasonal patterning of preeclampsia."
"Recession, local employment trends and change in self-reported health of individuals: A longitudinal study in England and Wales during the 'great recession'.","Asthma is a complex disease with multiple environmental factors proposed to contribute to aetiology. Geographical analyses can shed light on the determinants of asthma. Ultraviolet radiation has been associated with asthma prevalence in past ecological studies. We have increased the detail of examining the association between asthma and ultraviolet radiation with addition of the variables of temperature, relative humidity and precipitation. An ecological study was designed to investigate meteorological factors associated with asthma prevalence in England. Data from the 2005 quality outcomes framework were used to determine the prevalence of asthma in primary care in England. This information was supplemented with indicators of obesity and smoking of the General Practitioner practice and population (by age and sex), deprivation and ethnicity at lower super output level from the 2001 and 2011 census. Annual mean meteorological data was attained from the Met Office and Joint Research Centre. We used a multiple linear regression to examine individual and multiple climatic factors through a principal components analysis. We tested for an association with asthma prevalence, after taking into account the spatial autocorrelation of the data. Asthma prevalence from general practice surgeries in England was 5.88% (95% CI 5.83 to 5.92). In the highest ultraviolet radiation weighted by the pre-vitamin D action spectrum (UV<sub>vitd</sub>) quartile (2.12 to 2.50 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>/day), asthma had a 5% reduction in prevalence; compared to the lowest quartile here (0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98)). Similar reductions were found in the higher temperature 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 to 96). The opposite was found with relative humidity 1.09 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.12). A combination of high temperature and UVvitd highlighted postcode districts in the South East of England with a climate beneficial to low asthma prevalence. The South West of England represented a climate which had both beneficial and detrimental associations with asthma development. Climate is associated with asthma prevalence in England. Understanding the contribution of multiple climatic factors and the relationship with the indoor environment could help to explain the population distribution of asthma."
"Antenatal exposure to solar radiation and learning disabilities: Population cohort study of 422,512 children.","International literature shows unemployment and income loss during the Great Recession worsened population mental health. This individual-level longitudinal study examines how regional economic trends and austerity related to depression using administrative prescription data for a large and representative population sample."
"Association Between the Activity Space Exposure to Parks in Childhood and Adolescence and Cognitive Aging in Later Life.","Records from a sample of the Scottish Longitudinal Study (N=86 500) were linked to monthly primary care antidepressant prescriptions (2009-15). Regional economic trends were characterized by annual full-time employment data (2004-14). Economic impact of austerity was measured via annual income lost per working age adult due to welfare reforms (2010-15). Sequence analysis identified new cases of antidepressant use, and group-based trajectory modelling classified regions into similar economic trajectories. Multi-level logistic regression examined relationships between regional economic trends and new antidepressant prescriptions. Structural equation mediation analysis assessed the contributory role of welfare reforms."
"How has the introduction of point-of-sale legislation affected the presence and visibility of tobacco retailing in Scotland? A longitudinal study.","Employed individuals living in regions not recovering post-recession had the highest risk of beginning a new course of antidepressants (AOR 1.23; 95% CI 1.08-1.38). Individuals living in areas with better recovery trajectories had the lowest risk. Mediation analyses showed that 50% (95% CI 7-61%) of this association was explained by the impact of welfare benefit reforms on average incomes."
"Changing labour market conditions during the 'great recession' and mental health in Scotland 2007-2011: an example using the Scottish Longitudinal Study and data for local areas in Scotland.","Following the Great Recession, local labour market decline and austerity measures were associated with growing antidepressant usage, increasing regional inequalities in mental health. The study evidences the impact of austerity on health inequalities and suggests that economic conditions and welfare policies impact on population health. Reducing the burden of mental ill-health primarily requires action on the social determinants."
"Pathogen seasonality and links with weather in England and Wales: a big data time series analysis.","This paper examines trends in mental health among adults in England during the period of economic recovery and austerity following the 2008 'great recession'. We report analysis of data on 17,212 individuals living in England, from the longitudinal Understanding Society Survey (USS). We examined how individual's self-reported mental health over time (2011-2017), related to their changing socio-geographical status. Self-reported mental health is reported in the USS using version 2 of the SF12 Mental Component Summary. Trends in this score (across 5 observations per subject) were categorised into Mental Health Trajectory Groups (MHTGs) using Group Based Trajectory Modelling. We used maximum-likelihood multinomial logit models to estimate for individuals the relative likelihood of belonging to different Mental Health Trajectory categories as compared with a 'base' category, for whom mental health was good and stable throughout the period. We focus on likelihood of belonging to a group showing 'declining' mental health. Predictor variables included individuals' attributes and area conditions in their places of residence (including Office of National Statistics indicators of local employment deprivation and data on average income loss within districts due to welfare benefit reforms, published by the Centre of Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University, UK). Our results emphasise the multiple socio-geographical 'determinants' likely to be operating on individual mental health. Declining mental health was associated both with conditions at the start of the study period and with social and socio-geographical mobility by the end of the study period. Risks of declining mental health were significantly greater for more deprived individuals and also (controlling for individual attributes) among those living in English neighbourhoods that were already economically disadvantaged at the beginning of the 'great recession' and located in districts where average incomes were most severely impacted by the effects of governmental austerity programmes on welfare benefits."
"Association between Serum 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D Levels and the Prevalence of Adult-Onset Asthma.","Air pollution has been consistently linked with dementia and cognitive decline. However, it is unclear whether risk is accumulated through long-term exposure or whether there are sensitive/critical periods. A key barrier to clarifying this relationship is the dearth of historical air pollution data."
"A randomised control crossover trial of a theory based intervention to improve sun-safe and healthy behaviours in construction workers: study protocol.","To demonstrate the feasibility of modelling historical air pollution data and using them in epidemiologicalmodels."
"Green space and cognitive ageing: A retrospective life course analysis in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.","Using the EMEP4UK atmospheric chemistry transport model, we modelled historical fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations for the years 1935, 1950, 1970, 1980, and 1990 and combined these with contemporary modelled data from 2001 to estimate life course exposure in 572 participants in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 with lifetime residential history recorded. Linear regression and latent growth models were constructed using cognitive ability (IQ) measured by the Moray House Test at the ages of 11, 70, 76, and 79 years to explore the effects of historical air pollution exposure. Covariates included sex, IQ at age 11 years, social class, and smoking."
"Land cover and air pollution are associated with asthma hospitalisations: A cross-sectional study.","Higher air pollution modelled for 1935 (when participants would have been in utero) was associated with worse change in IQ from age 11-70 years (β = -0.006, SE = 0.002, p = 0.03) but not cognitive trajectories from age 70-79 years (p &gt; 0.05). There was no support for other critical/sensitive periods of exposure or an accumulation of risk (all p &gt; 0.05)."
"Occupational differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection: analysis of the UK ONS COVID-19 infection survey.","The life course paradigm is essential in understanding cognitive decline and this is the first study to examine life course air pollution exposure in relation to cognitive health."
"Longitudinal changes in proportionate mortality due to COVID-19 by occupation in England and Wales.","Over the past decade, antidepressant prescriptions have increased in European countries and the United States, partly due to an increase in the number of new cases of mental illness. This paper demonstrates an innovative approach to the classification of population level change in mental health status, using administrative data for a large sample of the Scottish population. We aimed to identify groups of individuals with similar patterns of change in pattern of prescribing, validate these groups by comparison with other indicators of mental illness, and characterise the population most at risk of increasing mental ill health."
"The relationship between greenspace and personal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> during walking trips in Delhi, India.","National Health Service (NHS) prescription data were linked to the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), a 5.3% sample of the Scottish population (N = 151,418). Antidepressant prescription status over the previous 6 months was recorded for every month for which data were available (January 2009-December 2014), and sequence dissimilarity was computed by optimal matching. Hierarchical clustering was used to create groups of participants who had similar patterns of change, with multi-level logistic regression used to understand group membership."
"Contamination of Air and Surfaces in Workplaces with SARS-CoV-2 Virus: A Systematic Review.","Five distinct prescription pattern groups were observed, indicating: no prescriptions (76%), occasional prescriptions (10%), continuation of prior use of prescriptions (8%), a new course of prescriptions started (4%) or ceased taking prescriptions (3%). Young, white, female participants, of low social grade, residing in socially deprived neighbourhoods, living alone, being separated/divorced or out of the labour force, were more likely to be in the group that started a new course of antidepressant prescriptions."
"Antenatal Exposure to UV-B Radiation and Preeclampsia: A Retrospective Cohort Study.","The use of sequence analysis for classifying individual antidepressant trajectories offers a novel approach for capturing population-level changes in mental health risk. By classifying individuals into groups based on their anti-depressant medication use we can better identify how over time, mental health is associated with individual risk factors and contextual factors at the local level and the macro political and economic scale."
"Climatic factors are associated with asthma prevalence: An ecological study using English quality outcomes framework general practitioner practice data.","This study contributes robust evidence on the association between mental health and local crime rates by showing how changing exposure to small area-level crime relates to self-reported and administrative data on mental health."
"A data linkage study of the effects of the Great Recession and austerity on antidepressant prescription usage.","The study sample comprised 112 251 adults aged 16-60 years, drawn from the Scottish Longitudinal Study, a 5.3% representative sample of Scottish population followed across censuses. Outcomes were individual mental health indicators: self-reported mental illness from the 2011 Census and linked administrative data on antidepressants and antipsychotics prescribed through primary care providers in the National Health Service in 2010/2012. Crime rates at data zone level (500-1000 persons) were matched to the participants' main place of residence, as defined by general practitioner patient registration duration during 2004/2006, 2007/2009 and 2010/12. Average neighbourhood crime exposure and change in area crime were computed. Covariate-adjusted logistic regressions were conducted, stratified by moving status."
"Trajectories in mental health and socio-spatial conditions in a time of economic recovery and austerity: A longitudinal study in England 2011-17.","In addition to average crime exposure during follow-up, recent increases in crime (2007/2009-2010/2012) were associated with a higher risk of self-reported mental illness, among 'stayers' aged 16-30 years (OR=1.11; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.22), and among 'movers' aged 31-45 years (OR=1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). Prescribed medications reinforced these findings; worsening crime rates were linked with antidepressant prescriptions among young stayers (OR=1.09; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.14) and with antipsychotic prescriptions among younger middle-aged movers (OR=1.11; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23)."
"Life Course Air Pollution Exposure and Cognitive Decline: Modelled Historical Air Pollution Data and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.","Changing neighbourhood crime exposure is related to individual mental health, but associations differ by psychiatric conditions, age and moving status. Crime reduction and prevention, especially in communities with rising crime rates, may benefit public mental health."
"Use of sequence analysis for classifying individual antidepressant trajectories to monitor population mental health.","Although neighborhood crime has been associated with mental health problems, longitudinal research utilizing objective measures of small-area crime and mental health service use is lacking. This study examines how local crime is associated with newly prescribed psychotropic medications in a large longitudinal sample of Scottish adults and explores whether the relationships vary between sociodemographic groups."
"Changing levels of local crime and mental health: a natural experiment using self-reported and service use data in Scotland.","Data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study, a 5.3% representative sample of the population, were linked with police-recorded crime in 2011 for residential locality and with psychotropic medications from 2009 to 2014, extracted from the prescription data set of National Health Service Scotland. Individuals receiving medication during the first 6 months of observation were excluded; the remaining sample was followed for 5.5 years. Covariate-adjusted, multilevel mixed-effects logistic models estimated associations between area crime and prescriptions for antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics (analyzed in 2018-2019)."
"Neighborhood Crime and Psychotropic Medications: A Longitudinal Data Linkage Study of 130,000 Scottish Adults.","After adjustment for individual and neighborhood covariates, findings on 129,945 adults indicated elevated risk of antidepressant (OR=1.05, 95% CI=1.00, 1.10) and antipsychotic (OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.03, 1.39), but not anxiolytic (OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.93, 1.05) medication in high-crime areas. Crime showed stronger positive association with antidepressants among individuals (especially women) aged 24-53 years in 2009 and with antipsychotics among men aged 44-53 years in 2009. Skilled workers and people from lower nonmanual occupations had increased risk of medications in high-crime areas."
"Exposure to Solar UV During Outdoor Construction Work in Britain.","Local crime is an important predictor of mental health, independent of individual and other contextual risk factors. Place-based crime prevention and targeting vulnerable groups may have benefits for population mental health."
"UVA and Seasonal Patterning of 56 370 Myocardial Infarctions Across Scotland, 2000-2011.","Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun in summer can cause skin cancer and in Britain there are around 1500 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) each year, caused by exposure to solar UV at work. Little is known about the magnitude of UV exposure amongst outdoor construction workers in Britain, although this is one of the main groups at risk. The aim of this paper is to summarise measurements of erythema-weighted UVB radiation amongst construction workers in Scotland and the Southeast of England and interpret the data in terms of the risk of NMSC. The measurements were made as part of an intervention study using short mobile phone text messages to alter worker behaviour to either reduce UV exposure in summer or increase serum vitamin D in winter; the intervention is only briefly reported here. Data were collected from 67 workers from 9 worksites, of whom 41 provided measures of UV exposure for 758 working days. Daily exposure ranged from 0 to 13.47 standard erythema dose (SED), with the mean exposure for outdoor workers being 2.0 SED and the corresponding value for indoor workers being 0.7 SED. These data were obtained from a sensor located on the back of the workers hard hat; others have measured exposure on the wrist or upper arm and these locations probably, on average, have higher levels of UV exposure. It is likely that an outdoor construction worker in Britain could accumulate sufficient solar UV exposure over 30-40 years of work to more than double their risk of NMSC. We argue that employers in Britain should take a more proactive approach to manage sun safety and they should take responsibility for skin health surveillance for their workers."
"Recession, local employment trends and change in self-reported health of individuals: A longitudinal study in England and Wales during the 'great recession'.","Tobacco displays at point of sale have been shown to increase young people’s pro-smoking attitudes, susceptibility to smoking and smoking initiation.

"Green space and cognitive ageing: A retrospective life course analysis in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.","Compliance with the point-of-sale legislation in Scotland was high. This led to a large reduction in the visibility of tobacco products in retail outlets. However, when the results were stratified by socioeconomic status, declines in retailer density, weighted by total product visibility, were restricted to the least disadvantaged tertile of participants. Nevertheless, the implementation of the legislation was associated with a reduction in risk of both smoking susceptibility and smoking initiation in young people, as well as a reduction in the perceived accessibility of tobacco and in pro-smoking attitudes after both the partial and the comprehensive bans were introduced."
"Land cover and air pollution are associated with asthma hospitalisations: A cross-sectional study.","The Scottish point-of-sale legislation has been successful in reducing the overall visibility of tobacco products and is associated with improvements in attitudinal and behavioural outcomes in young people. However, cues that tobacco is for sale are still highly visible, particularly in retail outlets in areas of deprivation. In addition, the increase in retailer density that was observed after 2015 increased inequalities in product visibility. There was also evidence that the emergence of e-cigarettes may have disrupted the full impact of the legislation."

"The relationship between greenspace and personal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> during walking trips in Delhi, India.","Background Myocardial infarction exhibits seasonal patterning, with higher amplitude at increased latitude. Epidemiological evidence suggests that sunlight is protective against cardiovascular disease, independent of ambient temperature, but ultraviolet B-mediated vitamin D production has been discounted as causal. We aimed to determine whether ultraviolet A is associated with the seasonal patterning of myocardial infarction. Methods and Results Routine hospitalization data were used to determine monthly incidence of myocardial infarction in Scotland between 2000 and 2011. Small-area-level aggregated data were obtained on ambient temperature from the Meteorological Office and ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B irradiance from NASA satellites. Autoregressive distributed lag models were run for ultraviolet A and myocardial infarction, including adjustment for ambient temperature and ultraviolet B. Monthly incidence of myocardial infarction displayed winter peaks and summer troughs superimposed on the underlying trend, with a mean amplitude of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.41) myocardial infarctions per 100 000 population per month. Ultraviolet A exposure was inversely associated with myocardial infarction independent of ambient temperature (coefficient, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.09, -0.01; <i>P</i>=0.015) and ultraviolet B UVB (coefficient, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.09, -0.02; <i>P</i>=0.004). Conclusions Further research is required to explore whether an ultraviolet-mediated mechanism different to vitamin D, such as nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation, may play a causal role in the seasonal and geographical patterning of myocardial infarction."
"Contamination of Air and Surfaces in Workplaces with SARS-CoV-2 Virus: A Systematic Review.","Learning disability varies by month of conception. The underlying mechanism is unknown but vitamin D, necessary for normal brain development, is commonly deficient over winter in high latitude countries due to insufficient ultraviolet radiation. We linked the 2007-2016 Scottish School Pupil Censuses to Scottish maternity records and to sunshine hours and antenatal ultraviolet A/B radiation exposure derived from weather stations and satellites respectively. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations between solar radiation, then ultraviolet B, and learning disabilities, adjusting for the potential confounding effects of month of conception and sex. Of the 422,512 eligible, singleton schoolchildren born at term in Scotland, 79,616 (18.8%) had a learning disability. Total antenatal sunshine hours (highest quintile; adjusted OR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.93; p &lt; 0.001) and ultraviolet B exposure (highest quintile; adjusted OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.60; p &lt; 0.001) were inversely associated with learning disabilities with evidence of a dose-relationship. The latter association was independent of ultraviolet A exposure. Significant associations were demonstrated for exposure in all three trimesters. Low maternal exposure to ultraviolet B radiation may play a role in the seasonal patterning of learning disabilities. Further studies are required to corroborate findings and determine the effectiveness of supplements."
"Antenatal Exposure to UV-B Radiation and Preeclampsia: A Retrospective Cohort Study.","The exposure to green space in early life may support better cognitive aging in later life. However, this exposure is usually measured using the residential location alone. This disregards the exposure to green spaces in places frequented during daily activities (i.e., the 'activity space'). Overlooking the multiple locations visited by an individual over the course of a day is likely to result in poor estimation of the environmental exposure and therefore exacerbates the contextual uncertainty. A child's activity space is influenced by factors including age, sex, and the parental perception of the neighborhood. This paper develops indices of park availability based on individuals' activity spaces (home, school, and the optimal route to school). These measures are used to examine whether park availability in childhood is related to cognitive change much later in life. Multi-level linear models, including random effects for schools, were used to test the association between park availability during childhood and adolescence and cognitive aging (age 70 to 76) in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 participants (N = 281). To test for the effect modification, these models were stratified by sex and road traffic accident (RTA) density. Park availability during adolescence was associated with better cognitive aging at a concurrently low RTA density (β = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.36 to 1.60), but not when the RTA density was higher (β = 0.22, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.51). Green space exposure during early life may be important for optimal cognitive aging; this should be evidenced using activity space-based measures within a life-course perspective."
"Climatic factors are associated with asthma prevalence: An ecological study using English quality outcomes framework general practitioner practice data.","Reducing the local availability of tobacco is identified as the 'next frontier' in tobacco control. This paper examines the roles of tobacco retail outlet density and tobacco visibility in changing exposure to tobacco retailing before and after the introduction of point-of-sale (POS) legislation in Scotland."
"A data linkage study of the effects of the Great Recession and austerity on antidepressant prescription usage.","National tobacco retailer register data were analysed to examine time trends in tobacco retailer density (2012-2017). Results were stratified by local authority, neighbourhood deprivation and urbanity. Next, an annual retail audit using a POS tobacco visibility tool assessed changes in total product visibility in all retail outlets in four study communities between 2013 and 2017. A longitudinal survey (2013-2017) of 5527 adolescents aged 12-17 in the four study communities enabled the calculation of residential and journey-to-school measures of tobacco retailer exposure. Trends were stratified by deprivation, urbanity and socioeconomic status."
"Trajectories in mental health and socio-spatial conditions in a time of economic recovery and austerity: A longitudinal study in England 2011-17.","Retail provision of tobacco declined following the introduction of the POS legislation in 2013. However, there were strong geographic differences; nationally, one-fifth of local authorities have increased provision since 2015. In the four study communities, tobacco retail provision was generally stable over the study period. Although product visibility of tobacco products reduced for adolescents there was growing socioeconomic disparity in the density of tobacco retailers and the visibility of tobacco storage."
"Life Course Air Pollution Exposure and Cognitive Decline: Modelled Historical Air Pollution Data and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.","The POS ban reduced exposure to tobacco products in communities across Scotland. However, tobacco products remain widely available, and there is growing socioeconomic disparity in the availability and visibility of tobacco."
"Use of sequence analysis for classifying individual antidepressant trajectories to monitor population mental health.","This paper reports research exploring how trends in local labour market conditions during the period 2007-2011 (early stages of the 'great recession') relate to reported mental illness for individuals. It contributes to research on spatio-temporal variation in the wider determinants of health, exploring how the lifecourse of places relates to socio-geographical inequalities in health outcomes for individuals. This study also contributes to the renewed research focus on the links between labour market trends and population health, prompted by the recent global economic recession. We report research using the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), a 5.3% representative sample of the Scottish population, derived from census data (https://sls.lscs.ac.uk/). In Scotland, (2011) census data include self-reported mental health. SLS data were combined with non-disclosive information from other sources, including spatio-temporal trends in labour market conditions (calculated using trajectory modelling) in the 32 local authority areas in Scotland. We show that, for groups of local authorities in Scotland over the period 2007-2011, trends in employment varied. These geographically variable trends in employment rates were associated with inequalities in self-reported mental health across the country, after controlling for a number of other individual and neighbourhood risk factors. For residents of regions that had experienced relatively high and stable levels of employment the odds ratio for reporting a mental illness was significantly lower than for the 'reference group', living in areas with persistently low employment rates. In areas where employment declined markedly from higher levels, the odds ratio was similar to the reference group. The findings emphasise how changes in local economic conditions may influence people's health and wellbeing independently of their own employment status. We conclude that, during the recent recession, the economic life course of places across Scotland has been associated with individual mental health outcomes."
"Changing levels of local crime and mental health: a natural experiment using self-reported and service use data in Scotland.","Many infectious diseases of public health importance display annual seasonal patterns in their incidence. We aimed to systematically document the seasonality of several human infectious disease pathogens in England and Wales, highlighting those organisms that appear weather-sensitive and therefore may be influenced by climate change in the future."
"Neighborhood Crime and Psychotropic Medications: A Longitudinal Data Linkage Study of 130,000 Scottish Adults.","Data on infections in England and Wales from 1989 to 2014 were extracted from the Public Health England (PHE) SGSS surveillance database. We conducted a weekly, monthly and quarterly time series analysis of 277 pathogen serotypes. Each organism's time series was forecasted using the TBATS package in R, with seasonality detected using model fit statistics. Meteorological data hosted on the MEDMI Platform were extracted at a monthly resolution for 2001-2011. The organisms were then clustered by K-means into two groups based on cross correlation coefficients with the weather variables."
"Exposure to Solar UV During Outdoor Construction Work in Britain.","Examination of 12.9 million infection episodes found seasonal components in 91/277 (33%) organism serotypes. Salmonella showed seasonal and non-seasonal serotypes. These results were visualised in an online Rshiny application. Seasonal organisms were then clustered into two groups based on their correlations with weather. Group 1 had positive correlations with temperature (max, mean and min), sunshine and vapour pressure and inverse correlations with mean wind speed, relative humidity, ground frost and air frost. Group 2 had the opposite but also slight positive correlations with rainfall (mm, &gt; 1 mm, &gt; 10 mm)."

"Recession, local employment trends and change in self-reported health of individuals: A longitudinal study in England and Wales during the 'great recession'.","The major circulating metabolite of vitamin D (25(OH)D) has been implicated in the pathogenesis for atopic dermatitis, asthma and other allergic diseases due to downstream immunomodulatory effects. However, a consistent association between 25(OH)D and asthma during adulthood has yet to be found in observational studies. We aimed to test the association between 25(OH)D and asthma during adulthood and hypothesised that this association would be stronger in non-atopic participants. Using information collected on the participants of the 1958 birth cohort, we developed a novel measure of atopic status using total and specific IgE values and reported history of eczema and allergic rhinitis. We designed a nested case-control analysis, stratified by atopic status, and using logistic regression models investigated the association between 25(OH)D measured at age 46 years with the prevalence of asthma and wheezy bronchitis at age 50 years, excluding participants who reported ever having asthma or wheezy bronchitis before the age of 42. In the fully adjusted models, a 10 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D prevalence had a significant association with asthma (aOR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88⁻1.00). There was some evidence of an atopic dependent trend in the association between 25(OH)D levels and asthma. Further analytical work on the operationalisation of atopy status would prove useful to uncover whether there is a role for 25(OH)D and other risk factors for asthma."
"Antenatal exposure to solar radiation and learning disabilities: Population cohort study of 422,512 children.","Exposure to sunlight can have both positive and negative health impacts. Excessive exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation from the sun can cause skin cancer, however insufficient exposure to sunlight has a detrimental effect on production of Vitamin D. In the construction industry there are onsite proactive behaviours for safety, but sun-safety remains a low priority. There is limited research on understanding the barriers to adopting sun-safe behaviours and the association this may have with Vitamin D production. This paper reports a protocol for an intervention study, using text messaging in combination with a supportive smartphone App. The intervention aims to both reduce UV exposure during months with higher UV levels and promote appropriate dietary changes to boost Vitamin D levels during months with low UV levels."
"Association Between the Activity Space Exposure to Parks in Childhood and Adolescence and Cognitive Aging in Later Life.","Approximately 60 construction workers will be recruited across the United Kingdom. A randomised control crossover trial (RCCT) will be used to test the intervention, with randomisation at site level - i.e. participants will receive both the control (no text messages or supportive App support) and intervention (daily text messages and supportive App). Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) the intervention focuses on supporting sun-safety and healthy dietary decisions in relation to Vitamin D intake. The intervention emphasises cultivating the perception of normative support in the workplace, increasing awareness of control and self-efficacy in taking sun-protective behaviours, making healthier eating choices to boost Vitamin D, and tackling stigmas attached to image and group norms. Each study epoch will last 21 days with intervention text messages delivered on workdays only. The supportive App will provide supplementary information about sun protective behaviours and healthy dietary choices. The primary outcome measure is 25-hydroxy-Vitamin D [25(OH)D] level (obtained using blood spot sampling), which will be taken pre and post control and intervention periods. Secondary outcome measures are two-fold, (1) using the TPB to detect changes in behaviour, and (2) quantifying UV exposure during the UK peak radiation season (April-September) using body-mounted UV sensors."

"Pathogen seasonality and links with weather in England and Wales: a big data time series analysis.","International evidence suggests that green space has beneficial effects on general and mental health but little is known about how lifetime exposure to green space influences cognitive ageing. Employing a novel longitudinal life course approach, we examined the association between lifetime availability of public parks and cognitive ageing. Lifetime residential information was gathered from the participants of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 using a ""life-grid"" questionnaire at age 78 years. Parks information from 1949, 1969 and 2009 was used to determine a percentage of parks within a 1500 m buffer zone surrounding residence for childhood, adulthood, and later adulthood periods. Linear regressions were undertaken to test for association with age-standardised, residualised change in cognitive function (Moray House Test score) from age 11 to 70 years, and from age 70 to 76 (n = 281). The most appropriate model was selected using the results of a partial F-test, and then stratified by demographic, genetic and socioeconomic factors. The local provision of park space in childhood and adulthood were both important in explaining the change in cognitive function in later life. The association between childhood and adulthood park availability and change in the Moray House Test Score from age 70 to 76 was strongest for women, those without an APOE e4 allele (a genetic risk factor), and those in the lowest socioeconomic groups. Greater neighbourhood provision of public parks from childhood through to adulthood may help to slow down the rate of cognitive decline in later life, recognising that such environmental associations are always sensitive to individual characteristics."
"Association between Serum 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D Levels and the Prevalence of Adult-Onset Asthma.","There is increasing policy interest in the potential for vegetation in urban areas to mitigate harmful effects of air pollution on respiratory health.
