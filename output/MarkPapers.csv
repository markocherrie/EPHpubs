"Preparation of Cotton-Zinc Composites by Magnetron Sputtering Metallization and Evaluation of their Antimicrobial Properties and Cytotoxicity.","The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the biological properties of cotton-zinc composites. A coating of zinc (Zn) on a cotton fabric was successfully obtained by a DC magnetron sputtering system using a metallic Zn target (99.9%). The new composite was characterized using scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), UV/Vis transmittance, and atomic absorption spectrometry with flame excitation (FAAS). The composite was tested for microbial activity against colonies of Gram-positive (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>) and Gram-negative (<i>Escherichia coli</i>) bacteria and antifungal activity against <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Chaetomium globosum</i> fungal mold species as model microorganisms. Cytotoxicity screening of the tested modified material was carried out on BALB/3T3 clone mouse fibroblasts. The SEM/EDS and FAAS tests showed good uniformity of zinc content on a large surface of the composite. The conducted research showed the possibility of using the magnetron sputtering technique as a zero-waste method for producing antimicrobial textile composites."
"A comparison of head movements tests in force plate and accelerometer based posturography in patients with balance problems due to vestibular dysfunction.","This study compares HS posturography on inertial sensors (MediPost) with force platform posturography in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction. The study group included 38 patients (age 50.6; SD 11.6) with unilateral vestibular weakness (UV) and 65 healthy volunteers (48.7; SD 11.5). HS tests were performed simultaneously on the force plate and with MediPost sensor attached at L4. Four conditions applied: eyes open/closed, firm/foam. The tests were performed twice, with the head moving at the frequency of 0.3&#xa0;Hz (HS 0.3) and 0.6&#xa0;Hz (HS 0.6). Mean sway velocity was significantly lower for MediPost than force plate in 4th condition both in UV and healthy group. For HS 0.3 the differences between devices were marginal; the highest sensitivity (87%) and specificity (95%) were in 4th condition. For HS 0.6 MediPost revealed lower sensitivity than force plate although the surface parameter improved results. MediPost IMU device and force platform posturography revealed a similar ability to differentiate between patients with balance problems in course of vestibular pathology and healthy participants, despite the differences observed between measuring methods. In some tests surface parameter may be more appropriate than sway velocity in improving MediPost sensitivity."
"Climatic factors are associated with asthma prevalence: An ecological study using English quality outcomes framework general practitioner practice data.","Asthma is a complex disease with multiple environmental factors proposed to contribute to aetiology. Geographical analyses can shed light on the determinants of asthma. Ultraviolet radiation has been associated with asthma prevalence in past ecological studies. We have increased the detail of examining the association between asthma and ultraviolet radiation with addition of the variables of temperature, relative humidity and precipitation. An ecological study was designed to investigate meteorological factors associated with asthma prevalence in England. Data from the 2005 quality outcomes framework were used to determine the prevalence of asthma in primary care in England. This information was supplemented with indicators of obesity and smoking of the General Practitioner practice and population (by age and sex), deprivation and ethnicity at lower super output level from the 2001 and 2011 census. Annual mean meteorological data was attained from the Met Office and Joint Research Centre. We used a multiple linear regression to examine individual and multiple climatic factors through a principal components analysis. We tested for an association with asthma prevalence, after taking into account the spatial autocorrelation of the data. Asthma prevalence from general practice surgeries in England was 5.88% (95% CI 5.83 to 5.92). In the highest ultraviolet radiation weighted by the pre-vitamin D action spectrum (UV<sub>vitd</sub>) quartile (2.12 to 2.50&#xa0;kJ/m<sup>2</sup>/day), asthma had a 5% reduction in prevalence; compared to the lowest quartile here (0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98)). Similar reductions were found in the higher temperature 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 to 96). The opposite was found with relative humidity 1.09 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.12). A combination of high temperature and UVvitd highlighted postcode districts in the South East of England with a climate beneficial to low asthma prevalence. The South West of England represented a climate which had both beneficial and detrimental associations with asthma development. Climate is associated with asthma prevalence in England. Understanding the contribution of multiple climatic factors and the relationship with the indoor environment could help to explain the population distribution of asthma."
"Posturography with head movements in the assessment of balance in chronic unilateral vestibular lesions.","The aim of our study was to validate the method of head-shake static posturography (HS-posturography) in healthy individuals and to establish the value of this novel method in the diagnostics of patients with unilateral vestibular lesion (UV). The study included 202 participants divided into two groups, one consisting of 133 patients with canal paresis CP&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;19% and one of 69 healthy subjects. Participant was tested according to the standard protocol of static posturography (SP), and with head movements of 0.3&#xa0;Hz (HS 40), 0.6&#xa0;Hz (HS 70) in random order controlled by a metronome. HS-posturography revealed a similar repeatability and internal consistency as the standard posturography. In patients with UV, 4th condition revealed higher sensitivity (74%) and specificity (71%) in HS 40 than in the standard posturography (67%, 65% respectively) and HS 70 (54%, 70% respectively). Static posturography and HS- posturography revealed a high reliability of the testing method. The head movements added to static posturography improve the sensitivity and specificity of the method in group with vestibular impairment. The most important test for that purpose seems to be the one on unstable surface with the eyes closed, with low frequency of head movements."
"Exposure to Solar UV During Outdoor Construction Work in Britain.","Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun in summer can cause skin cancer and in Britain there are around 1500 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) each year, caused by exposure to solar UV at work. Little is known about the magnitude of UV exposure amongst outdoor construction workers in Britain, although this is one of the main groups at risk. The aim of this paper is to summarise measurements of erythema-weighted UVB radiation amongst construction workers in Scotland and the Southeast of England and interpret the data in terms of the risk of NMSC. The measurements were made as part of an intervention study using short mobile phone text messages to alter worker behaviour to either reduce UV exposure in summer or increase serum vitamin D in winter; the intervention is only briefly reported here. Data were collected from 67 workers from 9 worksites, of whom 41 provided measures of UV exposure for 758 working days. Daily exposure ranged from 0 to 13.47 standard erythema dose (SED), with the mean exposure for outdoor workers being 2.0 SED and the corresponding value for indoor workers being 0.7 SED. These data were obtained from a sensor located on the back of the workers hard hat; others have measured exposure on the wrist or upper arm and these locations probably, on average, have higher levels of UV exposure. It is likely that an outdoor construction worker in Britain could accumulate sufficient solar UV exposure over 30-40 years of work to more than double their risk of NMSC. We argue that employers in Britain should take a more proactive approach to manage sun safety and they should take responsibility for skin health surveillance for their workers."
"Vitamin D and UV exposure in construction workers-a randomized control trial using text messaging to promote positive behaviours.","The aim of this study was to determine whether a text messaging intervention (supported by a smartphone application) would be effective in the promotion of sun-safe behaviours. Both excessive and insufficient exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation were considered."
"Vitamins A and E during Pregnancy and Allergy Symptoms in an Early Childhood-Lack of Association with Tobacco Smoke Exposure.","A randomized control crossover trial was conducted. 112 participants from nine sites in the United Kingdom contributed to the study. There were three intervention waves, two in winter (Vitamin D-focussed) and one in summer (UV exposure-focussed). Stages of Change, Standard Erythemal (UV) Dose and assayed blood samples (Vitamin D) were employed to evaluate the effectiveness throughout the 21-day data collection periods."
"A randomised control crossover trial of a theory based intervention to improve sun-safe and healthy behaviours in construction workers: study protocol.","The intervention was effective in promoting positive progression in Stages of Change for Vitamin D; and this in turn was predictive of increased Vitamin D levels in participants. More limited positive findings were found with respect to UV exposure. Overall, for those in the Intervention, Vitamin D levels were significantly predicted to increase during both of the winter data collection waves."
"Compensatory Puffing With Lower Nicotine Concentration E-liquids Increases Carbonyl Exposure in E-cigarette Aerosols.","Interventions of this type are recommended to promote healthy Vitamin-D levels in construction workers."
"Occupational skin diseases: actual state analysis of patient management pathways in 28 European countries.","Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between maternal antioxidant levels during pregnancy and development of allergic diseases in their offspring. The aim of the study was to determine plasma vitamins A and E concentration in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, at delivery and in cord blood and to search for a relationship with allergy in up to 2-year-old children who were prenatally exposed or not exposed to tobacco smoke. The study participants included 252 mother-child pairs from Polish Mother and Child Cohort. Vitamin concentrations were measured using the HPLC-UV method, smoking status&amp;mdash;as saliva cotinine level using the HPLC-MS/MS technique. Children&amp;rsquo;s health status was assessed using a questionnaire and pediatricians/allergists examination. Cord plasma vitamin concentrations were significantly lower than their levels in maternal plasma in the 1sttrimester and at delivery (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Significantly higher concentrations of vitamin E have been shown to occur during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in plasma of the women who have actively/passively smoked cigarettes compared to the non-smokers (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). Multivariate analysis with inclusion of a variety of confounding factors have not indicated any statistically significant associations between &amp;beta;-carotene, vitamins A and E and the risk of food allergy, atopic dermatitis and wheezing in their children up to 2 years of age. The interaction between smoking during pregnancy and vitamins levels on the risk of allergy was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.4). The relationship between plasma concentration of vitamins A and E, and the risk of allergy in their young children has not been demonstrated."
"[Ultraviolet exposure from indoor tanning devices as a potential source of health risks: Basic knowledge of the proper use of these devices for practical users, physicians and solarium staff].","Exposure to sunlight can have both positive and negative health impacts. Excessive exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation from the sun can cause skin cancer, however insufficient exposure to sunlight has a detrimental effect on production of Vitamin D. In the construction industry there are onsite proactive behaviours for safety, but sun-safety remains a low priority. There is limited research on understanding the barriers to adopting sun-safe behaviours and the association this may have with Vitamin D production. This paper reports a protocol for an intervention study, using text messaging in combination with a supportive smartphone App. The intervention aims to both reduce UV exposure during months with higher UV levels and promote appropriate dietary changes to boost Vitamin D levels during months with low UV levels."
"How Sensors Might Help Define the External Exposome.","Approximately 60 construction workers will be recruited across the United Kingdom. A randomised control crossover trial (RCCT) will be used to test the intervention, with randomisation at site level - i.e. participants will receive both the control (no text messages or supportive App support) and intervention (daily text messages and supportive App). Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) the intervention focuses on supporting sun-safety and healthy dietary decisions in relation to Vitamin D intake. The intervention emphasises cultivating the perception of normative support in the workplace, increasing awareness of control and self-efficacy in taking sun-protective behaviours, making healthier eating choices to boost Vitamin D, and tackling stigmas attached to image and group norms. Each study epoch will last 21&#xa0;days with intervention text messages delivered on workdays only. The supportive App will provide supplementary information about sun protective behaviours and healthy dietary choices. The primary outcome measure is 25-hydroxy-Vitamin D [25(OH)D] level (obtained using blood spot sampling), which will be taken pre and post control and intervention periods. Secondary outcome measures are two-fold, (1) using the TPB to detect changes in behaviour, and (2) quantifying UV exposure during the UK peak radiation season (April-September) using body-mounted UV sensors."

"A study of ground-level ozone pollution, ozone precursors and subtropical meteorological conditions in central Taiwan.","Article 20 of the European Tobacco Products Directive (EU-TPD) specifies that e-liquids should not contain nicotine in excess of 20 mg/mL, thus many vapers may be compelled to switch to lower concentrations and in so doing, may engage in more intensive puffing. This study aimed to establish whether more intensive puffing produces higher levels of carbonyl compounds in e-cigarette aerosols."
"Effects of in vitro exposure to power frequency magnetic fields on UV-induced DNA damage of rat lymphocytes.","Using the HPLC-UV diode array method, four carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, and acrolein) were measured in liquids and aerosols from nicotine solutions of 24 and 6 mg/mL. Aerosols were generated using a smoking machine configured to replicate puffing topography data previously obtained from 12 experienced e-cigarette users."
"Allergic contact dermatitis in a dental nurse induced by methacrylates.","Carbonyl levels in aerosols from the puffing regimen of 6 mg/mL were significantly higher (p &lt; .05 using independent samples t tests) compared with those of 24 mg/mL nicotine. For the 6 and 24 mg/mL nicotine aerosols respectively, means &#xb1; SD for formaldehyde levels were 3.41 &#xb1; 0.94, and 1.49 &#xb1; 0.30 &#xb5;g per hour (&#xb5;g/h) of e-cigarette use. Means &#xb1; SD for acetaldehyde levels were 2.17 &#xb1; 0.36 and 1.04 &#xb1; 0.13 &#xb5;g/h. Means &#xb1; SD for acetone levels were 0.73 &#xb1; 0.20 and 0.28 &#xb1; 0.14 &#xb5;g/h. Acrolein was not detected."
"Photoretinitis: an underestimated occupational injury?","Higher levels of carbonyls associated with more intensive puffing suggest that vapers switching to lower nicotine concentrations (either due to the EU-TPD implementation or personal choice), may increase their exposure to these compounds. Based on real human puffing topography data, this study suggests that limiting nicotine concentrations to 20 mg/mL may not result in the desired harm minimalization effect."
"The effect of depletion of the earth ozone layer on the human health condition.","More intensive puffing regimens associated with the use of low nicotine concentration e-liquids can lead to higher levels of carbonyl generation in the aerosol. Although in need of replication in a larger sample outside a laboratory, this study provides pragmatic empirical data on the potential risks of compensatory puffing behaviors in vapers, and can help to inform future regulatory decisions on nicotine e-liquid concentrations. The cap on nicotine concentration at 20 mg/mL set by the EU-TPD may therefore have the unintended consequence of encouraging use of lower nicotine concentration e-liquid, in turn increasing exposure to carbonyl compounds through compensatory puffing."
"Monitoring human risk and exposure to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using haemoglobin adducts as biomarkers.","Work-related skin diseases (WSD) are caused or worsened by a professional activity.

"Climatic factors are associated with asthma prevalence: An ecological study using English quality outcomes framework general practitioner practice data.","Besides a national health service or a statutory health insurance, most European member states implemented a second insurance scheme specifically geared at occupational diseases [insurance against occupational risks (synonyms: insurance against work accidents and occupational injuries; statutory social accident insurance)]. Legal standards for the assessment of occupationally triggered diseases with a genetic background differ between different countries, however, in most European member states recognition as OSD is possible. In one-third of the countries UV light-induced tumours can be recognized as OSD under specific conditions."
"Posturography with head movements in the assessment of balance in chronic unilateral vestibular lesions.","OSD definitions vary between European countries and are not directly comparable, which hampers comparisons between statistics collected in different countries. Awareness of this fact and further efforts for standardization are necessary."
"Exposure to Solar UV During Outdoor Construction Work in Britain.","Bearing in mind the adverse health effects of exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in solarium, especially the risk of carcinogenesis, there is a need to adopt legal regulations by relevant Polish authorities. They should set out the principles for indoor tanning studios operation, supervision and service of the technical parameters of tanning devices and training programs to provide the staff with professional knowledge and other aspects of safety in these facilities. The mechanism of the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on the human body, scale of overexposure, resulting from excessive sunbathing are described. Methods for estimating UV exposure and possible actions aimed at reducing the overexposure and preventing from cancer development caused by UV are also presented in this paper.

"Vitamins A and E during Pregnancy and Allergy Symptoms in an Early Childhood-Lack of Association with Tobacco Smoke Exposure.","The advent of the exposome concept, the advancement of mobile technology, sensors, and the ""internet of things"" bring exciting opportunities to exposure science. Smartphone apps, wireless devices, the downsizing of monitoring technologies, along with lower costs for such equipment makes it possible for various aspects of exposure to be measured more easily and frequently. We discuss possibilities and lay out several criteria for using smart technologies for external exposome studies. Smart technologies are evolving quickly, and while they provide great promise for advancing exposure science, many are still in developmental stages and their use in epidemiology and risk studies must be carefully considered. The most useable technologies for exposure studies at this time relate to gathering exposure-factor data, such as location and activities. Development of some environmental sensors (e.g., for some air pollutants, noise, UV) is moving towards making the use of these more reliable and accessible to research studies. The possibility of accessing such an unprecedented amount of personal data also comes with various limitations and challenges, which are discussed. The advantage of improving the collection of long term exposure factor data is that this can be combined with more ""traditional"" measurement data to model exposures to numerous environmental factors."
"A randomised control crossover trial of a theory based intervention to improve sun-safe and healthy behaviours in construction workers: study protocol.","This paper presents the strategy and results of in-flight measurements of airborne aldehydes during normal operation and reported ""smell events"" on commercial aircraft. The aldehyde-measurement is a part of a large-scale study on cabin-air quality. The aims of this study were to describe cabin-air quality in general and to detect chemical abnormalities during the so-called ""smell-events"". Adsorption and derivatization of airborne aldehydes on 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine coated silica gel (DNPH-cartridge) was applied using tailor-made sampling kits. Samples were collected with battery supplied personal air sampling pumps during different flight phases. Furthermore, the influence of ozone was investigated by simultaneous sampling with and without ozone absorption unit (ozone converter) assembled to the DNPH-cartridges and found to be negligible. The method was validated for 14 aldehydes and found to be precise (RSD, 5.5-10.6%) and accurate (recovery, 98-103 %), with LOD levels being 0.3-0.6 &#x3bc;g/m(3). According to occupational exposure limits (OEL) or indoor air guidelines no unusual or noticeable aldehyde pollution was observed. In total, 353 aldehyde samples were taken from two types of aircraft. Formaldehyde (overall average 5.7 &#x3bc;g/m(3), overall median 4.9 &#x3bc;g/m(3), range 0.4-44 &#x3bc;g/m(3)), acetaldehyde (overall average 6.5 &#x3bc;g/m(3), overall median 4.6, range 0.3-90 &#x3bc;g/m(3)) and mostly very low concentrations of other aldehydes were measured on 108 flights. Simultaneous adsorption and derivatization of airborne aldehydes on DNPH-cartridges to the Schiff bases and their HPLC analysis with UV absorbance detection is a useful method to measure aldehydes in cabin-air of commercial aircraft."
"Compensatory Puffing With Lower Nicotine Concentration E-liquids Increases Carbonyl Exposure in E-cigarette Aerosols.","Many employees working outside are exposed to the harmful effects of UV radiation.

Acute dermal irritation was tested using group of 3 rabbits for each absorber. The sensitization study was carried out on groups of 15 guinea pigs for each tested textile with a UV absorber showing an Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF)&gt;40. This research was designed according to OECD Test Guideline No. 404 and 406, and 21 rabbits and 60 guinea pigs were used in the study."
"How Sensors Might Help Define the External Exposome.","In acute dermal irritation, Z11 and A8G modifiers and the analyzed paste gave results of 0.047 to 0.33 which classifies them as barely perceptible irritants, whereas the other analyzed modifiers and dispersion gave results of 0.00 and were classified as nonirritating. Only the textile with TK 11 did not have UPF&gt;40. The analyzed barrier materials were classified as nonsenitizers (TDPK, A8G) or mild sensitizers (TK44, Z11)."
"Airborne aldehydes in cabin-air of commercial aircraft: Measurement by HPLC with UV absorbance detection of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones.","None of the analyzed materials or modifiers induced major skin reactions in animals. Therefore, they present low risk of provoking skin reactions in humans."
"Acute dermal toxicity and sensitization studies of novel nano-enhanced UV absorbers.","Hourly concentrations of ozone (O(3)), 55 volatile organic compounds (VOCs, ozone precursors) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were measured at an upwind urban site, a downwind suburban site, and a rural site in central Taiwan, from January 2003 to December 2006. VOC and NOx mean concentrations showed a gradient from high to low across the urban (56 ppb and 34 ppb), suburban (38 ppb and 27 ppb) and rural sites (25 ppb and 21 ppb) but a reverse gradient in ozone across these sites (24, 27, and 29 ppb, respectively). Although there was about twice the difference in VOC concentrations between the urban and rural sites, nearly 65% ozone formation potential was contributed to by the same 9 VOCs. Seasonal patterns showed peak ozone levels in autumn and minima in summer at the urban site, but minima in winter at the downwind suburban and rural sites. Ozone precursor levels, on the other hand, were lowest in summer and highest in winter. The diurnal pattern showed that ozone levels peaked one hour later at the rural site than at the urban site. The ethylbenzene to m,p-xylene ratio, an indicator of the age of the air mass, increased from 0.4 at the urban site to 0.6 at the suburban site and 0.8 at the rural site during daily peak ozone times. This finding suggests the transport of ozone and precursors from upwind to downwind producing elevated ozone levels in the suburban and rural areas. Ozone episodes occurred mostly in days with a mean midday UV index of 6.5 (1 UV index=100 J m(-2)) and wind speed at 1.3 m s(-1) at all three sites."
"A study of ground-level ozone pollution, ozone precursors and subtropical meteorological conditions in central Taiwan.","The mechanisms of biological effects of 50/60 Hz (power frequency) magnetic fields (MF) are still poorly understood. There are a number of studies indicating that MF affect biochemical processes in which free radicals are involved, such as the biological objects' response to ultraviolet radiation (UVA). Therefore, the present study was aimed to assess the effect of 50 Hz MFs on the oxidative deterioration of DNA in rat lymphocytes irradiated in vitro by UVA. UVA radiation (150 J/m2) was applied for 5 min for all groups and 50 Hz MF (40 microT rms) exposure was applied for some of the groups for 5 or 60 min. The level of DNA damage was assessed using the alkaline comet assay, the fluorescence microscope, and image analysis. It has been found that the 1 h exposure to MF caused an evident increase in all parameters consistent with damaged DNA. This suggest that MF affects the radical pairs generated during the oxidative or enzymatic processes of DNA repair."
"Effects of in vitro exposure to power frequency magnetic fields on UV-induced DNA damage of rat lymphocytes.","Allergy to acrylic plastics is rather frequent among doctors and dental technicians. A rare case of allergy to acrylates in a dental nurse (only one reports can be found in the literature) is presented. The patient reacted to eight chemical compounds of the group under study. UV-cured composites used in conservative dentistry for tooth filling was the source of allergy in the case under report."
"Allergic contact dermatitis in a dental nurse induced by methacrylates.","Non-ionizing radiation, which is produced in large amounts by welding arcs, may induce photophthalmia, keratoconjunctivitis and cataracts. Retinal injuries resulting from exposure to electric welding arcs have been reported, but such injuries are not commonly seen and may be misdiagnosed. A case is described of bilateral maculopathy in a millwright exposed to metal arc inert gas-shielded welding and oxygen lance light. Insurance adjudicators denied his claim, as they did not acknowledge the cause-and-effect relationship between welding and retinopathy. Welding emits a wide spectrum of radiation, ranging from IR to UV and beyond. UV and far-IR radiation are adsorbed by the cornea and the lens, whereas visible light and near-IR radiation penetrate to the retina. According to the intensity and time of exposure, they may cause thermal or photochemical retinal damage, which may be permanent and sight-threatening. Workers covered by compulsory collective insurance should be eligible for compensation in every case of welding light-induced retinal damage."
"Photoretinitis: an underestimated occupational injury?","Development of economic human activity has caused many harmful side effects which constitute an important danger for the biological life of our planet. This review discusses some aspects of the atmospheric changes and their influence on UV radiation reaching a man. The ozone-layer depletion is the result of emissions to the atmosphere chemical substances containing chlorine and bromine. Ozone, which absorbs the solar ultraviolet radiation, is a basic bio-protective filter. Degradation of the atmospheric ozone layer leads to increase of UV-level in our environment. The harmful effects of UV-radiation on live organisms constitute a danger for health of the whole human population. There is no doubt that cumulative exposure to UV radiation is important in the aetiology of skin cancer. A strong cataractogenic effect of UV radiation has been also evidenced. It is also known that the increase of UV radiation may be capable of activating viruses and reduce immunological response. The recent and predicted increase in these menaces are discussed."
"The effect of depletion of the earth ozone layer on the human health condition.","Two studies were carried out in a trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant using TNT haemoglobin (TNT-Hb) adduct as a biomarker to study dose-adduct and adduct-response relationships. In the first study, TNT-Hb adduct levels were determined in 117 TNT-exposed workers in different working sites with different exposure conditions. External exposure was calculated from the inhaled air concentration plus skin contamination. TNT-Hb adduct levels in blood were significantly correlated with their external exposure to TNT. Two methods, HPLC-UV and CI-ELISA, were developed for measuring TNT-Hb adduct: good correlations (r = 0.77 and 0.86) were found between these 2 methods. In the second study, TNT cataract was used as an indicator of health effects. The prevalence of cataract and the degree of lenticular damage increased with the increase of blood TNT-Hb level."
